Summary: Flutter Web Build Failure – Cause & Fix

Cause
firebase_options.dart was missing.
This file is auto-generated by FlutterFire CLI and is required when using Firebase in Flutter.

Step 1: Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

Step 2: Use FlutterFire via full path (PATH not set yet)
$HOME/.pub-cache/bin/flutterfire --version

Step 3: Install Firebase CLI
sudo npm install -g firebase-tools

Step 4: Login to Firebase (server-safe way)
firebase login --no-localhost

Step 5: Generate Firebase config
$HOME/.pub-cache/bin/flutterfire configure

Step 6: Verify file exists
ls lib/firebase_options.dart

Step 7: Build Flutter Web (skip WASM check)
flutter build web --no-wasm-dry-run

Standard Workflow After git pull
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter build web --no-wasm-dry-run
