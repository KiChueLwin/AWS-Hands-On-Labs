# AWS Three-Tier Architecture Demo

## Overview
This project implements a three-tier architecture on AWS consisting of
a web tier, application tier, and database tier. The goal of this lab
is to understand secure network design, instance provisioning, and
managed database services on AWS.

## Architecture
- Public Subnet: EC2 web server
- Private Subnet: RDS MySQL database
- S3 bucket: static assets
- Internet Gateway + Route Tables
- Security Groups controlling access between tiers

## AWS Services Used
- VPC
- EC2
- RDS MySQL
- S3
- IAM
- CloudWatch (basic monitoring)

## What I Did
- Created custom VPC with public and private subnets
- Launched EC2 instance in public subnet
- Created RDS MySQL in private subnet (no public access)
- Allowed EC2 to access DB via security groups
- Stored static files in S3 bucket
- Tested connectivity and locking down inbound rules

## Validation
- Web application accessible from public internet
- Database accessible only from EC2, not internet

## What I Learned
- 3-tier architecture concepts
- Difference between security groups and NACLs
- VPC subnet design and routing
- Secure database design patterns
